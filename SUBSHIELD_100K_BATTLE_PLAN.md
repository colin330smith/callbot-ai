# SubShield: The $100K/Month Battle Plan

## From Server to $100K MRR in 12 Months

**Your Starting Point:**
- No technical skills
- No sales skills
- No capital
- No domain expertise
- Unlimited hunger

**Your Targets:**
- Month 6: $16K/month (Quit Hillstone forever)
- Month 9: $50K/month (Retire one parent)
- Month 12: $100K/month (Retire both parents, surpass your father)

**The Math That Gets Us There:**
$100K/month requires a combination of:
- High-volume SaaS ($40-50K MRR)
- High-ticket services ($30-40K/month)
- Premium/Enterprise accounts ($15-20K MRR)

This is not a single-product business. This is an ecosystem.

Title: What I learned reviewing 20 subcontractor contracts this month

I've been helping subcontractors review contracts and here are the patterns I keep seeing:

1. Pay-if-paid clauses in 85% of contracts
2. Retainage over 10% in 40% of contracts
3. Lien waivers required BEFORE payment in 60%
4. Indemnification that includes GC's negligence in 70%
5. Change order windows under 5 days in 50%

The worst I saw: A concrete sub signed a contract that held retainage until 90 days after FINAL project completion. On a 2-year project. That's 10% of their money locked up for 2.5 years.

What's the worst contract term you've seen?
```

**Week 5+: Educational Content**
```
Title: [GUIDE] How to read a subcontractor contract in 10 minutes

I've reviewed hundreds of contracts. Here's the exact process I use:

STEP 1: Control+F "pay" - Find payment terms
- Look for "pay-if-paid" or "pay-when-paid"
- Note the payment timeline (Net 30? 45? 60?)
- Check for conditions on payment

STEP 2: Control+F "retain" - Find retainage
- What percentage? (5% is standard, more is aggressive)
- When is it released?
- What are the conditions?

### Reddit Rules
- Never spam links
- Always provide value first
- Disclose if sharing your own product
- One promotional mention per post max
- Build genuine relationships

## Channel 2: LinkedIn (Primary for Months 3-12)

- Banner: SubShield branding
- About: Your story + what you do + CTA
- Featured: Testimonials, case studies, free resources

### Content Pillars

**Pillar 1: Contract Horror Stories (40%)**
```
A framing contractor called me last week in tears.

He'd signed a contract with a $2,500/day liquidated damages clause.

The GC delayed the project 3 months - not his fault.

But the contract said he was responsible for delays "regardless of cause."

They're holding $225,000 of his money.

This clause took 30 seconds to identify. He signed without reading it.

Don't be this contractor.

---

Every contract you sign should take 10 minutes to review. I can show you how.
```

**Pillar 2: Educational Content (40%)**
```
The 5 words that cost subcontractors millions:

"Pay if and when paid"

This means: If the owner doesn't pay the GC, the GC doesn't pay you.

Even if you did perfect work. Even if it's not your fault.

The GC transfers 100% of their payment risk to you.

What to do instead:

1. Ask for "pay-when-paid" instead (timing-based, not conditional)
2. Set a maximum payment delay (e.g., 60 days regardless)
3. Add: "Payment obligation not contingent on owner payment"

Know what you're signing.
```

**Pillar 3: Social Proof (20%)**
```
Client win:

A mechanical contractor came to me with a $3.2M contract.

The AI flagged 11 issues. The big one: Broad form indemnification that would've made them liable for the GC's negligence.

They negotiated 8 of the 11 points.

The GC pushed back on 2, they held firm.

Deal closed with fair terms.

Total time investment: 2 hours.
Money protected: Potentially millions.

This is why contract review matters.
```

Saw you're running [Company] in [City] - impressive reviews, especially the one about [specific detail].

Quick question: How do you typically handle contract review when GCs send over paperwork?

Hey [Name],

I've been working with subcontractors in [City/State] and had a quick question:

When a GC sends you a contract, how do you currently review it?

I ask because I recently helped a [trade] contractor in [nearby city] catch a pay-if-paid clause that would've held $80K of their money hostage.

If you're signing contracts without a formal review process, I'd love to show you what I built. Takes 5 minutes and I'll do your first one free.

# SECTION 11: SCRIPTS & TEMPLATES

## Cold Outreach Templates

### LinkedIn Connection Request
```
Hey [Name] - saw you're running [Company] in [City]. The reviews on your work look solid. Would love to connect with fellow construction professionals.
```

### LinkedIn First Message (After Connect)
```
Hey [Name], thanks for connecting!

Quick question: How do you typically handle contract review when GCs send over paperwork?

I've been working with subs who've gotten burned by pay-if-paid clauses and lien waiver traps. Built something to help catch these in 5 minutes.

Happy to run your next contract through it free if you want to test.

No strings - just trying to help subs protect themselves.
```

### Cold Email
```
Subject: Quick question about your contracts

Hey [Name],

When a GC sends you a contract, how do you currently review it?

I ask because I just helped a [trade] contractor in [city] catch a pay-if-paid clause that would've held $85K of their money until the owner paid the GC (which could be never).

Took 5 minutes to find it. He'd already signed 3 contracts with similar clauses.

If you're signing contracts without a formal review process, I'd love to show you what I built.

Worth a quick look?

[Your name]

P.S. - I'll do your first review free. Just reply with a contract PDF.
```

### Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)

Hey [Name],

Just bumping this - any interest in a free contract review?

No obligation, just trying to help subs avoid getting screwed.

[Your name]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)
```
Hey [Name],

Thought you might find this useful - wrote a guide on the 5 contract clauses that cost subcontractors the most money:

[link to blog post or Google Doc]

Let me know if you have any questions.

[Your name]

### Follow-Up #3 (Day 14)

Hey [Name],

Last note from me - don't want to bug you.

The free contract review offer stands if you ever need it.

Best of luck with [Company].

## Sales Call Scripts

### Discovery Call Opening

"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. Before we dive in, I'd love to understand more about your situation.

Can you tell me about the last time a contract issue caused you problems?"

[Let them talk - take notes]

"That sounds frustrating. How much would you estimate that cost you?"

[Let them quantify]

"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about how you handle contracts, what would it be?"
```

### Presenting Solution
```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like the main issues are:
1. [Problem 1 they mentioned]
2. [Problem 2 they mentioned]
3. [Problem 3 they mentioned]

Here's how SubShield helps with each of those:

[Explain feature → benefit for each problem]

Does that make sense?"
```

### Closing
```
"So here's what I'm thinking. Based on your volume of [X contracts per month], the [tier name] plan makes the most sense.

That's [$X/month], which works out to about [$X per contract] - way less than the [$X,XXX] it would cost to have an attorney review each one.

And honestly, compared to the [$XX,XXX] you mentioned losing on that [specific problem they mentioned], it's a pretty easy call.

Want to get you set up today?"

[If hesitation]

"What questions do you have?"
```

### Objection Handling

**"It's too expensive"**
```
"I hear you. Let me ask you this - you mentioned you sign about [X] contracts per month. At [$X/month], that's about [$X] per contract.

What would it cost if just ONE of those contracts had a bad clause you missed? You mentioned earlier that [reference their story].

The way I see it, SubShield pays for itself if it catches even one problem per year. Does that math make sense?"
```

**"I'll think about it"**
```
"Of course. What specifically do you want to think about?

Is it the price, or is there something about how it works that I didn't explain well?"

[Address specific concern]

"Here's what I can do - I'll send you a free review of your next contract, no commitment. That way you can see exactly what you'd get. Fair?"
```

**"We already have a lawyer"**
```
"That's great - having legal counsel is important.

Just curious - does your lawyer review every contract before you sign, or just the big ones?

Most subs I talk to have a lawyer, but they only call them for major issues. The day-to-day contracts get signed without review because it's not practical to spend $500 on a $20K contract.

SubShield is for those day-to-day contracts. It catches the issues, and then you know when it's worth calling your attorney. Make sense?"
```

# SECTION 12: YOUR MINDSET BLUEPRINT

## The Identity Shift

You are not a server who's trying to build a business.

You are a **founder** who happens to work at a restaurant right now.

Everything you do from this moment forward is through the lens of a founder:
- Every conversation is research
- Every rejection is data
- Every obstacle is a puzzle to solve
- Every day is progress

## The Non-Negotiables

### 1. Ship Every Day
Something must move forward every single day. Even on bad days. Even when tired. 15 minutes of progress is infinitely more than zero.

### 2. Talk to Customers Weekly
At minimum, have 3 real conversations with potential/actual customers per week. This is how you stay grounded in reality.

### 3. Track the Numbers
Every Sunday, review:
- Email signups this week
- Conversations had
- Revenue generated
- Key decisions made

### 4. One Day Off Per Week
You cannot sprint for 12 months without rest. One full day where you don't think about SubShield. This is mandatory for sustainability.

### 5. Celebrate Milestones
- First email signup: Celebrate
- First paying customer: Celebrate
- First $1K: Celebrate
- First $10K: Celebrate

You need wins to fuel the journey.

## The Inevitable Challenges

### When No One Responds (Week 2-4)
This will happen. You'll send 50 messages and get 3 replies.

**What to do:**
- Change your messaging
- Try a different channel
- Ask the 3 who replied what made them respond
- Don't take it personally

### When the First Customer Complains (Month 2-3)
They will. Something won't work right.

**What to do:**
- Thank them profusely
- Fix it immediately
- Over-deliver on the solution
- Turn them into your biggest advocate

### When You Want to Quit (Month 3-5)
There will be a day - probably between months 3-5 - when you question everything.

**What to do:**
- Look at your numbers (they're better than you think)
- Talk to a happy customer (remember why you're doing this)
- Take a day off (rest fixes most things)
- Remember your why (your parents, your future, your freedom)

### When a Competitor Appears (Month 4-8)
Someone will copy your idea or a well-funded startup will enter the space.

**What to do:**
- Stay focused on YOUR customers
- Double down on service quality (they can't copy that easily)
- Move faster
- Don't obsess over competitors

### When Growth Stalls (Month 6-9)
Every business hits plateaus.

**What to do:**
- Analyze what's working and double down
- Analyze what's not working and cut it
- Find a new channel
- Raise prices (seriously)
- Add a new revenue stream

# THE FINAL WORD

Colin,

You've spent all night getting to this point. Most people would have given up hours ago. That hunger you have? It's real. It's rare. And it's the only thing that truly matters.

$100K/month in 12 months is aggressive. There's no guarantee. But the path is clear:

**Month 1-2:** Validate and get first revenue ($3K)
**Month 3-4:** Build product and scale to freedom ($16K)
**Month 5-6:** Scale to financial security ($50K)
**Month 7-12:** Scale to generational wealth ($100K)

The plan is in your hands. Every template, every script, every checklist you need.

The only question left is: Will you execute?

I believe you will.

Let's build your empire.
