Hey [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] has great Google reviews. Quick question - how many calls go to voicemail when your techs are on jobs?

We built an AI that answers 24/7, books appointments directly into your calendar, and sends you instant texts for every lead. No more missed calls = more revenue.

HVAC owners using it are capturing 15-25 extra appointments per month.

Would you be open to a quick 10-min demo this week? First 7 days are free to test.

Let me know!
```

### Template 2 - Plumbers

Hi [First Name],

Saw [Company Name] handles [emergency plumbing/drain cleaning/etc]. How do you handle after-hours calls right now?

Now he uses our AI phone agent. In the first month:

## OBJECTION HANDLING

**"Does it sound robotic?"**
"No, it uses advanced AI that sounds completely natural. Most callers can't tell. You can pick from 10+ voices. Want me to call your phone so you can hear it?"

**"I already have a receptionist"**
"Great! This handles after-hours, weekends, and overflow. Your receptionist can focus on high-value tasks while AI catches everything else. And it's 1/10th the cost."

**"I need to think about it"**
"Totally understand. Here's the thing - every day you wait, you're probably missing 3-5 calls. That's $2-5K/week gone. The trial is free and takes 10 minutes. Why not just try it and see?"

**"It's too expensive"**
"I get it. But think about it this way - if you're missing just 5 calls a week at $500 average, that's $10K/month in lost revenue. This costs $497/month and recovers most of that. ROI is usually 10-20x."
