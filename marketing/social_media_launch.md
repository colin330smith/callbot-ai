1/ We just launched something we've been working on for months:

CallBot AI - an AI receptionist that answers your business phone 24/7

Here's why this matters for local businesses:

2/ The problem: Local businesses miss 30-40% of incoming calls.

85% of those callers never try again.

At $500+ per lead, that's brutal.

3/ The solution: An AI that:
- Answers in 3 seconds (every time)
- Sounds human (not robotic)
- Books appointments to your calendar
- Sends you instant notifications
- Works 24/7/365

4/ Real results from our beta:
- Dental office: +37 appointments/month
- HVAC company: 91% answer rate (up from 61%)
- Law firm: Captures leads at 2am

5/ Pricing:
- Starter: $297/mo (500 minutes)
- Growth: $497/mo (1500 min + SMS follow-up)
- Agency: $997/mo (white-label for agencies)

7-day free trial. No contracts.

6/ We built this because my friend runs a plumbing company.

He was losing $15K/month in missed calls but couldn't afford a full-time receptionist ($4K/mo).

Now his AI answers every call for $297/mo.

7/ Ready to stop missing calls?

Big announcement!

After months of development, we're launching CallBot AI - your business's 24/7 AI phone receptionist.

- Answers in 3 seconds, every time
- Books appointments directly to your calendar
- Texts you instantly about important calls
