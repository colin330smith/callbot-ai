# Outreach Email Templates

## Template 1: Cold Email - Pain Point Focus

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- "Quick question about [Business Name]'s phones"
- "Missed any calls this week?"
- "[Name], who answers when you're busy?"

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Quick question: What happens when someone calls [Business Name] and you're with a customer, on a job, or it's after hours?

Most [industry] businesses miss 40-60% of their calls. Each one could be a $[avg ticket] customer gone to a competitor.

We built an AI that answers your phone 24/7:
- Sounds human (seriously, listen to a demo)
- Books appointments directly to your calendar
- Texts you instantly with lead details
- Costs less than 1 hour of employee time per day

Want to hear it in action? I'll set up a free demo call where you can test it yourself.

Takes 2 minutes. Just reply "demo" and I'll send a link.

[Your name]

P.S. We're offering the first month free for businesses that sign up this week.

## Template 2: Value Proposition Focus

**Subject:** Never miss another [HVAC call / legal inquiry / appointment request]

Hi [Name],

I help [industry] businesses stop losing customers to voicemail.

Our AI answers your phone 24/7, books appointments, and qualifies leads - while you focus on [doing the actual work / seeing patients / running jobs].

One [industry] owner told me: "I was losing 10+ calls a week. Now I catch every single one. My [bookings/cases/appointments] are up 35%."

Worth a 15-min call to see if it'd work for [Business Name]?

# Cold Call Script

**Opening:**
"Hi, is this [Name]? Great, this is [Your name]. I'll be quick because I know you're busy. I help [industry] businesses stop losing customers to voicemail. Can I ask you a quick question?"

**Question:**
"When someone calls [Business Name] and you're [on a job / in court / with a patient], what happens to that call?"

**Listen, then:**
"That's exactly what I hear from most [industry] owners. Here's what we do - we built an AI that answers your phone 24/7, sounds completely human, books appointments, and texts you instantly with lead details. One [industry] owner told me his [bookings/cases] went up 35% in the first month."

**Ask:**
"Would it be worth 15 minutes to show you how it works? I can do a live demo where you call in and test it yourself."

**Handle objections:**

*"I already have a receptionist"*
"That's great - this isn't to replace them. It's for when they're busy, at lunch, or after hours. Think of it as backup that never takes a break. Does your receptionist work weekends and evenings?"

*"How much does it cost?"*
"$497/month - less than $17/day. But here's how to think about it: if it catches just ONE extra lead per month that you would have missed, it's paid for itself 3-4x over. Most of our clients see way more than that."

*"I need to think about it"*
"Totally understand. How about this - let me set up a free 7-day trial so you can see the results before you decide. No credit card, no commitment. If it doesn't work for you, just cancel. Fair enough?"

*"I'm not interested"*
"No problem at all. Mind if I ask - is it because you're not missing calls, or something else? [Listen] Got it. If anything changes, feel free to reach out. Have a great day."
