## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Risk Score: 8/10

This contract is heavily weighted in favor of the General Contractor and contains several clauses that could result in significant financial loss for the subcontractor. The pay-if-paid clause (Article 3.2) shifts all risk of owner non-payment to you — if the owner doesn't pay, you don't get paid, period. Combined with unconditional lien waivers required before you receive payment (Article 4), you could complete $347,000 worth of work and have no legal recourse if something goes wrong. The indemnification clause (Article 6) is extremely broad and may require you to cover the GC's own negligence. This contract should not be signed without negotiating at least the top 3 issues below.

### Top 3 Priority Issues

| Priority | Issue | Risk | Section |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Pay-If-Paid clause transfers all owner payment risk to you | **HIGH** | §3.2 |
| 2 | Unconditional lien waivers required before payment received | **HIGH** | §4.1-4.3 |
| 3 | Broad indemnification includes GC's own negligence | **HIGH** | §6.1 |

## PAYMENT ANALYSIS

### Pay-If-Paid Clause
**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Contract Language (§3.2):**
> "It is expressly understood and agreed that Contractor's receipt of payment from Owner for Subcontractor's work is a condition precedent to Contractor's obligation to make payment to Subcontractor. Subcontractor expressly assumes the risk of Owner's nonpayment for any reason whatsoever, and the Subcontract Price includes this assumption of risk. If Owner fails to pay Contractor for Subcontractor's work, Contractor shall have no obligation to pay Subcontractor, regardless of whether Subcontractor has fully performed."

**What This Means:**
This is a textbook pay-if-paid clause with all three elements courts look for: (1) "condition precedent" language, (2) express assumption of risk, and (3) clear statement you won't be paid if owner doesn't pay. If the owner goes bankrupt, disputes the GC's work, or simply refuses to pay — you get nothing. Your perfect work doesn't matter. The GC has no obligation to pursue the owner or share any recovery with you.

**Florida State Note:**
Florida courts generally enforce pay-if-paid clauses when clearly written like this one. Florida Statute §713.346 does limit their effect on lien rights — a pay-if-paid clause cannot waive your right to file a lien. However, see Article 4.3 which attempts to waive your lien rights separately.

**Recommended Action:**
This is the #1 issue to negotiate. At minimum, request a pay-when-paid clause instead (see negotiation script below).

---

### Payment Timeline
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- Invoice submission: By the 25th of each month
- Payment due: 45 days after receipt of approved invoice
- Conditions: Payment is contingent on owner payment (see above)

**Assessment:** 45 days is longer than industry standard (typically 30 days) but not unreasonable. However, combined with the pay-if-paid clause, the actual payment timeline could be indefinite.

---

### Retainage
**Risk Level: HIGH**

- Amount held: **10%**
- Release trigger: "Final completion of the entire Project AND receipt of final payment from Owner"
- Additional condition: Must wait 60 days after those events

**Contract Language (§3.3-3.4):**
> "Contractor shall retain ten percent (10%) of each progress payment until final completion of the entire Project and receipt of final payment from Owner."

**Assessment:** 10% retainage on a $347,000 contract = **$34,700** held back. The release is tied to TWO conditions you don't control: (1) final completion of the entire project (not just your work), and (2) owner paying the GC. If other trades delay the project or the owner disputes final payment, your $34,700 could be held for months or years. There's no time limit on when retainage must be released.

---

## LIEN RIGHTS ANALYSIS

### Lien Waiver Requirements
**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Contract Language (§4.1):**
> "As a condition precedent to each progress payment, Subcontractor shall provide Contractor with an unconditional waiver and release of lien for all work performed and materials supplied through the date of the previous Application for Payment."

**What This Means:**
You must sign an UNCONDITIONAL lien waiver to get your progress payment. "Unconditional" means it's effective immediately — you're giving up your lien rights before you even confirm the check cleared. If the GC's payment to you bounces or is stopped, you've already waived your right to file a lien for that work.

**Contract Language (§4.3):**
> "Subcontractor waives any right to file or assert a mechanic's lien against the Project or any bond related thereto for any amounts owed under this Agreement."

**What This Means:**
This is a blanket lien waiver for the entire project. Combined with §4.1, you're being asked to give up your primary legal protection for getting paid.

**Florida State Note:**
Florida has statutory lien waiver forms (Florida Statute §713.20). The contract should use these forms. More importantly, Florida Statute §713.346 provides that a pay-if-paid clause cannot operate to defeat a subcontractor's lien rights. Article 4.3's blanket waiver may be an attempt to circumvent this protection. This clause is likely **unenforceable** under Florida law, but you should still negotiate to remove it.

**Recommended Action:**
Request conditional waivers (effective only upon receipt of payment) and delete Article 4.3 entirely.

---

## INDEMNIFICATION ANALYSIS

### Indemnification Scope
**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Contract Language (§6.1):**
> "To the fullest extent permitted by law, Subcontractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contractor, Owner, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, arising out of or resulting from: (a) The performance of the Work, regardless of whether such claim is caused in whole or in part by the negligence or fault of any party indemnified hereunder..."

**What This Means:**
You're agreeing to pay for claims even when the GC or Owner caused the problem. Read that again: "regardless of whether such claim is caused... by the negligence or fault of any party indemnified." If a worker gets injured because of the GC's unsafe site conditions, this clause says you pay. If the Owner's architect made a design error that causes damage, this clause says you pay.

**Florida State Note:**
Florida Statute §725.06 limits indemnification in construction contracts. A provision requiring indemnification for the indemnitee's own negligence is **void and unenforceable** in Florida. The "to the fullest extent permitted by law" language is the GC's attempt to save the clause, but the broad language in (a) likely exceeds what Florida allows. You should still request language that clearly limits indemnification to your own negligence.

**Recommended Action:**
Request standard "comparative fault" indemnification that only covers claims arising from your own negligence.

---

## CHANGE ORDER PROVISIONS

### Notice Requirements
**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Contract Language (§5.2):**
> "Subcontractor must provide written notice to Contractor within twenty-four (24) hours of discovering any condition that may require a change in the Work or result in additional costs. Failure to provide such notice within the required time shall constitute a waiver of any claim for additional compensation or time extension."

**Risk:** 24 hours is extremely tight. If you discover unforeseen conditions on a Friday afternoon and don't send written notice until Monday, you've waived your right to any extra compensation. The "written notice" requirement also means verbal discussion doesn't count.

**Contract Language (§5.4):**
> "Contractor may direct Subcontractor to proceed with changed work pending execution of a formal Change Order. Subcontractor shall proceed with such work and shall not delay progress pending resolution of pricing disputes."

**Risk:** You can be ordered to do extra work before agreeing on price. Combined with the 24-hour notice requirement, you could perform thousands of dollars of extra work with no guarantee of payment.

**Recommended Action:**
Request 72 hours (3 business days) for notice and require written acknowledgment before proceeding with disputed change work.

---

## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

- **Method:** Binding arbitration (AAA Construction Industry Rules)
- **Venue:** Orange County, Florida
- **Attorney Fees:** Prevailing party recovers fees
- **Work During Dispute:** Must continue working (§11.3)

**Assessment:** Arbitration can be faster than litigation but limits your discovery rights and appeal options. The venue in Orange County is reasonable if you're based in Central Florida. The prevailing party fee provision cuts both ways — good if you win, costly if you lose. The requirement to continue working during disputes is standard but means you can't use work stoppage as leverage.

---

## OTHER RED FLAGS

### Liquidated Damages
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Contract Language (§9.2):**
> "Subcontractor agrees to pay liquidated damages in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per calendar day for each day of delay beyond the scheduled completion date, unless such delay is caused solely by Contractor or Owner."

**Assessment:** $500/day sounds modest, but note it requires the delay to be caused "solely" by the GC or Owner for you to be excused. If there's shared responsibility for a delay, you could still be on the hook. A 30-day delay = $15,000 out of your pocket.

### Scope Creep
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Contract Language (§1.1):**
> "...including but not limited to all work reasonably inferable from the drawings and specifications."

**Contract Language (§1.3):**
> "Subcontractor acknowledges that the scope of work may be modified at the sole discretion of the Contractor to accommodate project requirements."

**Assessment:** "Including but not limited to" and "reasonably inferable" language can be used to claim work is in your scope when it wasn't explicitly listed. §1.3 gives the GC unilateral power to modify your scope. Combined with the change order provisions, you could be required to do additional work without additional pay.

### Warranty
**Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

- Duration: 2 years from substantial completion
- Response time: 24 hours to respond, 72 hours to complete repairs

**Assessment:** 2 years is longer than the typical 1-year warranty but not unreasonable for commercial work. The 24/72 hour response requirements are tight — make sure you can meet them.

## NEGOTIATION SCRIPTS

### Priority 1: Pay-If-Paid Clause (§3.2)

**Current Language:**
> "Contractor's receipt of payment from Owner for Subcontractor's work is a condition precedent to Contractor's obligation to make payment to Subcontractor..."

**Request This Change:**
> "Contractor shall pay Subcontractor within forty-five (45) days of receipt of an approved Application for Payment. If Contractor has not received corresponding payment from Owner, Contractor shall nonetheless pay Subcontractor within ninety (90) days of the approved Application for Payment."

**How to Ask:**
"I reviewed the payment terms and wanted to discuss Section 3.2. As written, if the owner doesn't pay for any reason — even reasons that have nothing to do with my work — I don't get paid. That's a risk I can't take on a $347,000 contract. I'm fine with you having extra time to pay if the owner is slow, but I need some backstop. Can we change this to a pay-when-paid with a 90-day outside date? That gives you time to collect from the owner, but I'm not left holding the bag indefinitely if something goes wrong between you and the owner."

---

### Priority 2: Lien Waivers (§4.1 and §4.3)

**Current Language:**
> "...unconditional waiver and release of lien..."
> "Subcontractor waives any right to file or assert a mechanic's lien..."

**Request This Change:**
> "As a condition precedent to each progress payment, Subcontractor shall provide Contractor with a conditional waiver and release of lien in the form prescribed by Florida Statute §713.20, which shall become effective upon Subcontractor's receipt of payment."

> [Delete §4.3 entirely]

**How to Ask:**
"On the lien waivers — I'm happy to provide waivers with each payment, but they need to be conditional waivers that only take effect when the check clears. I can't sign away my lien rights before I actually have the money in hand. Florida has standard statutory forms for this. Also, Section 4.3 asks me to waive all lien rights upfront, which I don't think is enforceable under Florida law anyway. Can we use conditional waivers and remove 4.3?"

---

### Priority 3: Indemnification (§6.1)

**Current Language:**
> "...regardless of whether such claim is caused in whole or in part by the negligence or fault of any party indemnified hereunder..."

**Request This Change:**
> "Subcontractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contractor and Owner from claims arising out of or resulting from Subcontractor's negligent acts, errors, or omissions in the performance of the Work, but only to the extent such claims are caused by Subcontractor's negligence. This indemnification shall not extend to claims arising from the negligence or fault of Contractor, Owner, or their agents."

**How to Ask:**
"The indemnification clause as written asks me to cover claims even when they're caused by someone else's negligence. I don't think that's enforceable under Florida's anti-indemnity statute anyway, but I'd rather have clean contract language. Can we revise it to a standard comparative fault indemnity where I'm responsible for claims caused by my work, and you're responsible for claims caused by yours? That's fair to both sides and clearly enforceable."

---

### Priority 4: Change Order Notice (§5.2)

**Current Language:**
> "...within twenty-four (24) hours of discovering any condition..."

**Request This Change:**
> "Subcontractor must provide written notice to Contractor within five (5) business days of discovering any condition that may require a change in the Work..."

**How to Ask:**
"The 24-hour notice window for change orders is pretty tight. If I find something unexpected on a Friday, I could miss the deadline over the weekend. Can we change that to 5 business days? That still keeps things moving but gives reasonable time to evaluate and document the situation properly."

---

### Priority 5: Retainage Release (§3.3)

**Current Language:**
> "...until final completion of the entire Project and receipt of final payment from Owner."

**Request This Change:**
> "Contractor shall retain ten percent (10%) of each progress payment. Fifty percent (50%) of retainage shall be released within thirty (30) days after Subcontractor's work is substantially complete and accepted. The remaining retainage shall be released within thirty (30) days after final completion of the Project or twelve (12) months after Subcontractor's substantial completion, whichever occurs first."

**How to Ask:**
"On retainage — I understand holding 10% during the project. But as written, I could finish my work in month 3 and not see that money until the entire building is done a year later. Can we structure it so half the retainage releases when my scope is complete, and the rest either at project closeout or after 12 months, whichever comes first? That way I'm not financing other trades' work."

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### ☐ SIGN AS-IS

### ☐ SIGN WITH CAUTION

### ☑ NEGOTIATE FIRST
Significant issues should be addressed before signing. See negotiation scripts above.

### ☐ WALK AWAY

---

**Our Recommendation: NEGOTIATE FIRST**

This contract has multiple high-risk clauses that could result in you completing $347,000 of work and getting paid $0 if circumstances outside your control go wrong. The pay-if-paid clause, unconditional lien waivers, and broad indemnification are the most concerning. The good news: some of these clauses may not be enforceable under Florida law anyway, and the GC may be willing to negotiate because they know that. Start with the pay-if-paid clause — that's your biggest exposure. Many GCs will agree to pay-when-paid with a time limit. If they won't negotiate on anything, consider whether this GC is someone you want to work with long-term.
