### POST TYPE 1: STORY POSTS (Highest Engagement)

#### Post 1: The $47K Lesson
**Title:** I got burned by a pay-if-paid clause. Don't make my mistake.

**Body:**
Been doing concrete work for 12 years. Thought I'd seen every contract trick in the book.

Last year I signed what looked like a standard contract with a GC I'd worked with before. Big project, good money.

Buried in paragraph 14 was pay-if-paid language. Didn't think twice about it.

Owner got into a dispute with the GC 6 months in. Stopped paying.

GC pointed at paragraph 14. "We only pay when we get paid."

$47,000 in completed work. Zero payment. And it was completely legal.

My lawyer said I should've caught it. Easy for him to say - guy charges $400/hour to read contracts.

Now I go through every single contract line by line. Here's what I look for:

1. **Pay-if-paid vs pay-when-paid** - huge difference. Pay-when-paid means they pay you within X days. Pay-if-paid means maybe never.

2. **Lien waiver timing** - if they want unconditional waivers BEFORE you get paid, run.

3. **Indemnification scope** - if you're covering the GC's negligence, that's a problem.

4. **Retainage release** - no release date = your money held hostage.

What contract clauses have burned you guys? Trying to compile a list of what to watch for.

#### Post 2: Negotiation Win
**Title:** Just negotiated 3 changes to a contract. Here's exactly what I said.

**Body:**
Got a contract last week that had some sketchy terms. Instead of just signing it (like I used to), I actually pushed back. Here's what happened.

**Issue 1: Pay-if-paid clause**

Original: "Payment due when Owner pays Contractor"

What I said: "Hey, I noticed the payment terms are contingent on owner payment. I've had issues with these before. Can we change it to net 30 from invoice approval? Protects your cash flow flexibility while giving me a timeline I can count on."

Result: Changed to net 45. Not perfect but way better.

**Issue 2: 10% retainage, no release date**

Original: "10% retainage until final completion and acceptance"

What I said: "I see retainage is 10% held until final. On a 14-month project that ties up a lot of cash. Would you consider 5%, or releasing half at substantial completion?"

Result: 5% with 50% release at substantial completion. Win.

**Issue 3: Unconditional lien waivers upfront**

Original: "Unconditional lien waiver required with each pay application"

What I said: "The lien waiver provision asks for unconditional waivers before payment. Standard practice in [state] is conditional until the check clears. Can we adjust this?"

Result: Changed to conditional waivers. Unconditional after payment clears.

Whole conversation took 20 minutes. GC wasn't thrilled but agreed to everything.

Point is: **most GCs will negotiate if you ask professionally.** They want to work with good subs more than they want to fight over contract terms.

What terms have you successfully negotiated?

#### Post 3: Warning Post
**Title:** PSA: If your contract says this, don't sign it

**Body:**
Helping my buddy review a contract yesterday. Holy shit.

Some of the language I found:

1. "Subcontractor shall indemnify Contractor from **any and all claims arising from or related to the Work**" - That "any and all" includes the GC's own screw-ups. One accident that's their fault, you're paying.

2. "Final payment contingent upon Owner's acceptance and release of retainage to Contractor" - Translation: you might wait 2+ years for your last check.

3. "Changes to Work require written notice within **24 hours** or Subcontractor waives additional compensation" - Good luck documenting everything in 24 hours on a busy job site.

4. "Subcontractor shall provide **unconditional lien waiver** with each payment application" - You're giving up your right to file a lien BEFORE you get paid. Insane.

All in one contract. From a GC with a decent reputation.

They're not evil - they're just using templates their lawyer gave them that protect them and screw you.

**What to do:**

- Actually read the contract (yeah, all 30 pages)
- Know your state's laws (pay-if-paid isn't even enforceable in some states)
- Ask for changes - the worst they can say is no
- Walk away if they won't budge on the bad stuff

What's the worst contract language you've seen?

### POST TYPE 2: QUESTION/DISCUSSION POSTS

#### Post 4: Seeking Opinions
**Title:** How do you guys handle contract review? Too expensive to have a lawyer look at everything.

**Body:**
Running a small plumbing outfit. We sign maybe 10-15 contracts a month.

Can't afford to have a lawyer review every single one at $300-500 a pop. But I also can't afford to miss something important.

Currently I just skim for the obvious stuff - payment terms, insurance requirements. But I know I'm missing things.

How do you guys handle this? Do you:

1. Just sign and hope for the best?
2. Have a lawyer review only the big ones?
3. Use some kind of checklist?
4. Something else?

Especially curious what the smaller shops do. The guys doing $1M+ probably have lawyers on retainer but that's not me yet.

---

#### Post 5: Specific Question
**Title:** Pay-if-paid clause - is this actually enforceable in [State]?

**Body:**
Got a contract with this language:

"Subcontractor's right to receive payment is contingent upon Contractor's receipt of payment from Owner for the Work."

My understanding is pay-if-paid isn't enforceable in some states. Anyone know about [State]?

And even if it is enforceable, any tips on negotiating it out?

### POST TYPE 3: VALUE POSTS (Build Authority)

#### Post 6: Guide Post
**Title:** The 5 contract clauses that cost subs the most money (and how to spot them)

**Body:**
Been in the trades 15 years, ran my own shop for 8. Here's what I've learned the hard way about contracts.

**1. Pay-if-paid clauses**

What it looks like: "Payment contingent upon Contractor receiving payment from Owner"

Why it's bad: You did the work. You deserve to get paid. This makes your payment dependent on someone else's problem.

What to do: Ask for pay-when-paid with a time cap (net 30, net 45) instead.

**2. Unconditional lien waiver requirements**

What it looks like: "Subcontractor shall provide unconditional lien waiver with each payment application"

Why it's bad: You're signing away your lien rights BEFORE the check clears. Check bounces? Too bad.

What to do: Conditional waivers until payment clears. Unconditional after.

**3. Broad form indemnification**

What it looks like: "Subcontractor shall indemnify Contractor from any and all claims..."

Why it's bad: "Any and all" = you're covering the GC's negligence too. Their mistake, your bill.

What to do: Add "except to the extent caused by Contractor's negligence"

**4. Impossible change order requirements**

What it looks like: "Written notice required within 24-48 hours"

Why it's bad: On a busy job site, you can't document everything that fast. Miss the window, lose your money.

What to do: Ask for 7 days, or at least 72 hours.

**5. Retainage without release date**

What it looks like: "10% retainage until final completion and acceptance"

Why it's bad: "Acceptance" could be years. That's your cash flow held hostage.

What to do: Specific release date, or 50% at substantial completion.

### COMMENT TEMPLATES (For Engaging in Other Posts)

#### When someone complains about not getting paid:
"This sucks. Was there a pay-if-paid clause in your contract? A lot of subs don't realize those are in there until it's too late. Some states don't even enforce them - worth checking with a lawyer."

#### When someone asks about starting a business:
"Congrats on taking the leap. One thing I'd add - get really good at reading contracts before you sign them. The terms in GC contracts are designed to protect them, not you. Learn the red flags early."

#### When someone shares a contract horror story:
"This is exactly why I started reading every word of every contract. It's tedious but it's saved me multiple times. The GC isn't evil - they're just using templates that protect them. You have to protect yourself."

### POST TYPE 1: STORY POSTS

#### LinkedIn Post 1: Origin Story
```
I watched a $47,000 contract clause destroy a subcontractor's year.

Pay-if-paid.

Three words buried in paragraph 14.

He did the work.
He did it well.
He never got paid.

Owner had a dispute with the GC.
GC pointed to the clause.
"We only pay when we get paid."

Completely legal.

That subcontractor was me.

After that, I started reading every line of every contract.

Here's what I learned:

Most GCs aren't evil.
They're using templates their lawyers gave them.
Templates designed to protect them.

Your job is to protect yourself.

The clauses that cost subs the most:
→ Pay-if-paid (payment depends on owner paying GC)
→ Unconditional lien waivers (give up rights before getting paid)
→ Broad indemnification (cover GC's negligence)
→ Excessive retainage (cash flow held hostage)

Read your contracts.
Every word.
Every time.

What's the worst contract term you've encountered?

#### LinkedIn Post 2: Quick Win
```
A 20-minute conversation saved me $12,000 last month.

I was about to sign a contract with 10% retainage.
No release date.
14-month project.

Instead of signing, I asked:

"Would you consider 5% retainage with 50% release at substantial completion?"

The GC said yes.

That's it.

No lawyers.
No conflict.
Just a question.

$12,000 back in my cash flow.

Most subs don't realize:

GCs EXPECT you to negotiate.
The first draft is never final.
The worst they can say is no.

What contract terms have you successfully negotiated?
```

#### LinkedIn Post 3: Controversial/Hot Take
```
Unpopular opinion:

Subcontractors sign bad contracts because they're scared to ask questions.

Not because they can't read.
Not because they're dumb.

Because they think:
- "If I push back, I'll lose the job"
- "This is just how it works"
- "Everyone signs these"

Here's the truth:

Good GCs WANT good subs.

They'll negotiate reasonable terms because:
→ Finding quality subs is hard
→ Rebidding costs time and money
→ Reputation matters in this industry

Yes, some GCs are inflexible.
Walk away from those.

But most?
They'll work with you if you ask professionally.

Stop signing contracts out of fear.

Start reading.
Start asking.
Start protecting yourself.

What's one contract term you wish you'd pushed back on?

### POST TYPE 2: EDUCATIONAL

#### LinkedIn Post 4: Listicle
```
5 contract red flags every subcontractor should know:

1. "Pay-if-paid" language
→ Your payment depends on the owner paying the GC
→ Ask for "pay-when-paid" with a 30-45 day cap instead

2. Unconditional lien waivers upfront
→ You sign away rights BEFORE getting paid
→ Request conditional waivers until check clears

3. "Any and all" indemnification
→ You're covering the GC's negligence too
→ Add "except caused by Contractor's negligence"

4. 24-48 hour change order notice
→ Nearly impossible on busy sites
→ Ask for 7 days minimum

5. Retainage with no release date
→ Your money held indefinitely
→ Get a specific date or 50% at substantial completion

Read your contracts.
Every word.
Every time.

Save this post. You'll need it.

#### LinkedIn Post 5: Process Post
```
How I review a subcontractor contract in 15 minutes:

Step 1: Payment terms (page 1, usually)
→ When do I get paid?
→ What are the conditions?
→ Is it pay-if-paid or pay-when-paid?

Step 2: Retainage (same section)
→ What percentage?
→ When is it released?
→ Any conditions?

Step 3: Lien waivers (Ctrl+F "waiver")
→ Conditional or unconditional?
→ When are they due?
→ Can I protect myself?

Step 4: Indemnification (Ctrl+F "indemnify")
→ What am I liable for?
→ Does it include GC's negligence?
→ Is my insurance okay with this?

Step 5: Change orders (Ctrl+F "change")
→ Notice requirements?
→ Time limits?
→ Pricing mechanisms?

Step 6: Termination
→ What can they terminate for?
→ What do I get paid if terminated?
→ What's my cure period?

That's it.

15 minutes could save you thousands.

What's your contract review process?
