## EMAIL 1: INSTANT DELIVERY
**Send: Immediately**

**Subject:** Your contract checklist is inside

**Body:**
```
Hey,

Thanks for checking out SubShield.

You're on the list for early access. When we launch, you'll be first in line - plus you'll get the founding member rate (50% off, locked in forever).

In the meantime, here's something you can use today:

**THE 5-MINUTE CONTRACT CHECKLIST**

Before you sign your next contract, search for these exact phrases:

1. **"contingent upon"** or **"when paid"**
   → Pay-if-paid language. Your payment depends on the owner paying the GC.

2. **"unconditional"** + **"waiver"**
   → You're signing away lien rights BEFORE you get paid.

3. **"indemnify"** + **"any and all"**
   → You're covering the GC's mistakes, not just your own.

4. **"notice"** + **"24 hours"** or **"48 hours"**
   → Impossible change order deadlines.

5. **"retainage"** (check for release date)
   → If there's no release date, your money could be held for years.

Ctrl+F is your friend.

More coming soon.

SubShield

P.S. - If you have a contract you're unsure about right now, just reply to this email with it attached. I'll personally review it and send you back what I find. No charge.

## EMAIL 2: THE $47K STORY
**Send: 2 days later**

**Subject:** The $47,000 contract clause

**Body:**
```
Quick story.

A concrete contractor in Texas signed what looked like a standard subcontract. He'd worked with this GC before. No reason to think anything was different.

Buried in paragraph 14: pay-if-paid language.

The owner got into a dispute with the GC six months later. Payments stopped.

The GC pointed to paragraph 14.

"We only pay when we get paid. Take it up with the owner."

$47,000 in completed work. Zero payment. Completely legal.

His lawyer told him he should've caught it. Easy to say at $400/hour.

---

Here's the thing: that contractor did nothing wrong. He just didn't know what to look for.

GCs aren't evil. They're using templates their lawyers gave them - templates designed to protect the GC, not you.

Your job is to protect yourself.

SubShield is the tool I wish that contractor had. Upload a contract, get back a full risk analysis in plain English. Know exactly what you're signing.

Early access is coming soon. You're already on the list.

- Colin

P.S. - Seriously, if you have a contract you're about to sign, reply with it attached. I'll tell you if there's anything to worry about. Free.

## EMAIL 3: OBJECTION HANDLER
**Send: 4 days later**

**Subject:** "I have a lawyer for that"

**Body:**
```
I hear this a lot:

"I have a lawyer review my contracts."

Great. You should.

But here's the math:

- Average contract review: $287-$500
- Contracts you sign per month: 5-10
- Annual cost if you review everything: $17,000-$60,000

So what actually happens?

You only send the "big" contracts to your lawyer. The rest? You skim and sign.

That's where the problems hide.

The contract that bankrupts a sub is rarely the million-dollar project with the big-name GC. It's the "routine" $80K job with the clause nobody read.

---

SubShield isn't meant to replace your lawyer. It's your first line of defense.

Think of it like this:

- SubShield screens every contract (fast, cheap)
- You send the flagged ones to your lawyer (targeted, worth the money)
- You stop paying $400 to hear "looks fine" on contracts that are actually fine

$147 per contract analysis. 49% cheaper than the average lawyer review.

And you get word-for-word negotiation scripts included.

Coming soon. Reply if you want to test it before launch.

## EMAIL 4: SOCIAL PROOF
**Send: 7 days later**

**Subject:** What I found in a contract yesterday

**Body:**
```
Ran an analysis on a contract yesterday. Electrical sub in Florida.

Here's what the AI flagged:

1. **Pay-if-paid clause** (Section 5.2)
   Risk: Payment depends entirely on owner paying GC

2. **Unconditional lien waivers** (Section 7.1)
   Risk: Signing away rights before check clears

3. **"Any and all" indemnification** (Section 9.3)
   Risk: Covering GC's negligence, not just his own

4. **5% retainage, no release date** (Section 5.4)
   Risk: Cash held indefinitely

5. **3-day change order notice** (Section 8.2)
   Risk: Nearly impossible to document in time

Overall risk score: 73/100 (High Risk)

I sent him back negotiation scripts for each issue. He used them. GC agreed to change 3 of the 5.

That's a contract that would've quietly screwed him. Now it's a contract he can live with.
