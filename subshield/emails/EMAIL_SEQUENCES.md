# SubShield Email Sequences

## SEQUENCE 1: WELCOME SEQUENCE (Waitlist)

Trigger: Someone signs up for early access

---

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)

**Subject:** You're in - here's your free contract review

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Welcome to SubShield. You're now on the early access list.

As promised, here's your free contract review:

**Just reply to this email with a contract PDF attached.** I'll personally run it through our AI and send you back a full risk analysis within 24 hours.

No catch. No obligation. Just want to show you what SubShield can do.

While you wait for launch, here are the 3 contract clauses that cost subcontractors the most money:

1. **Pay-if-paid clauses** - You don't get paid until the GC gets paid. Could be months. Could be never.

2. **Unconditional lien waivers** - Signing away your right to file a lien BEFORE you receive payment. Big mistake.

3. **Broad form indemnification** - You become liable for the GC's negligence. One lawsuit could end your business.

If any of these are in your current contracts, you need to know.

Talk soon,
[Your name]
SubShield

P.S. - Reply with that contract whenever you're ready. First come, first served on the free reviews.

### Email 2: Value Email (Day 2)

**Subject:** The $47,000 mistake (true story)

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Quick story about why I built SubShield.

A concrete contractor in Texas signed what he thought was a standard contract. Good GC, big project, seemed straightforward.

Buried in paragraph 14 was a pay-if-paid clause.

The owner got into a dispute with the GC. Stopped paying.

The GC? They pointed to paragraph 14. "We only pay when we get paid."

**$47,000 of completed work. Zero payment. Completely legal.**

The contractor had no idea that clause was in there. He'd signed dozens of contracts with similar language and never got burned - until he did.

That's the thing about bad contract terms. They're fine until they're not. And by then, it's too late.

This is why I built SubShield. So you never sign something you don't understand.

Have you sent over that contract for your free review yet? Just reply to this email with the PDF.

### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** "Found 3 issues I would have missed"

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Quick update - been doing free contract reviews for early SubShield users.

Here's what one said after getting his analysis:

> "Found 3 major issues in a contract I was about to sign. Pay-if-paid clause, 15% retainage with no release date, and indemnification that covered the GC's negligence. I negotiated 2 of the 3 before signing. Would have missed all of them."

This is exactly why SubShield exists.

Not to replace lawyers (you should still have one for the big stuff).

But to be your first line of defense. The thing that catches the obvious traps so you know what questions to ask.

Still have that free review available if you want it. Just reply with a contract PDF.

**Body:**

Welcome to SubShield. Let's get you protected.

In about 2 minutes, you'll have:
- Overall risk score (1-100)

### Email 2: First Analysis Follow-up (Day 1)

**Subject:** Did you see your risk score?

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Checking in - did you get a chance to analyze your first contract?

If your risk score was above 60, you've got some clauses worth negotiating next time.

If it was below 40, nice job - you're signing better contracts than most.

**Quick tip for your next analysis:**

When SubShield flags a pay-if-paid clause, here's the exact script to use with your GC:

> "Hey, I noticed section [X] has pay-if-paid language. I've had issues with these before. Any chance we can change it to pay-when-paid with a 45-day cap? That way you still have flexibility but I have a timeline I can count on."

Most GCs will negotiate this. They want to work with you.

Need help with a specific clause? Reply and let me know.

### Email 3: Feature Highlight (Day 3)

**Subject:** The feature most people miss

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Most SubShield users don't know about this feature:

**The Negotiation Scripts.**

When you click on any flagged clause, scroll down past the explanation. There's a section called "How to Bring This Up."

It's word-for-word language you can use with the GC. Written to be firm but not confrontational.

Example for excessive retainage:

> "I see retainage is set at 10% with release at final completion. On a 14-month project, that's a lot of cash flow tied up. Would you consider 5% or a partial release at substantial completion? Happy to discuss."

This is the stuff that actually gets results.

Try it on your next contract negotiation.

**Subject:** How's it going?

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Week one with SubShield - how's it going?

Quick questions:
- Have you analyzed a contract yet?
- Did you find any surprises?
- Anything confusing about the reports?

I read every reply personally. If something's not working, I want to fix it.

And if SubShield has already saved you from a bad clause - I'd love to hear about it.

Hey {first_name},

I'll be direct: it looks like you might not be using SubShield anymore.

Before you cancel, I'd love to know why.

- Is the product not what you expected?
- Not signing enough contracts to justify it?
- Found something better?
- Just forgot about it?

Reply with a number (1-4) or just tell me what's up.

If there's something I can fix, I will.

### Email 1: Retainer Introduction

**Subject:** You're reviewing a lot of contracts

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

I noticed you've been putting SubShield to work - {contract_count} contracts analyzed this month.

At that volume, wanted to let you know about our retainer service:

**Monthly Retainer - $997/month**
- Unlimited contract reviews with human oversight
- Direct access to me via text/email
- 48-hour turnaround
- Monthly strategy call
- I personally review any high-stakes contracts

For subcontractors signing 10+ contracts per month, the retainer pays for itself if it catches even one bad deal.

Interested? Reply and let's talk about whether it makes sense for your volume.

No pressure either way - the Pro plan is great for most people.

### Retainer Pitch (After One-Time Review)

**Subject:** Quick thought on your contract volume

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Thanks for using SubShield for that {gc_name} contract.

Quick question: How many contracts do you sign per month on average?

If it's more than 5, our monthly retainer might make more sense than one-off reviews:

**$997/month gets you:**
- Unlimited reviews with my personal oversight
- 48-hour turnaround (not 24, being honest)
- Direct text/email access when something urgent comes up
- Monthly 30-min strategy call

At 5+ contracts per month, you'd be paying $1,500+ for one-off reviews. Retainer saves you money and gives you faster access.

Worth a 15-min call to see if it fits?

{calendly_link}

Either way, glad the review was helpful.

### Testimonial Request

**Subject:** Quick favor?

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Really glad SubShield helped you catch {specific_issue} on that {project_name} contract.

Quick favor - would you be willing to write a 2-3 sentence testimonial about your experience?

Even something simple like:

> "Before SubShield, I [problem]. Now I [solution]. It's [benefit]."

Your words help other subcontractors trust that this is legit.

Totally understand if you're too busy. Either way, thanks for being a customer.

### Referral Request

**Subject:** Know any other subs?

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Quick question: Do you know any other subcontractors who might benefit from SubShield?

If you send them my way, I'll give both of you a free month.

Just have them mention your name when they sign up, or forward them this email.

Thanks for spreading the word.
