## PROBLEM SECTION

### Section Header
**The Contract Problem Nobody Talks About**

### Problem Points

**You're signing contracts you don't fully understand.**

Every week, GCs send you contracts packed with:

- **Pay-if-paid clauses** that mean you don't get paid until they do (which could be never)
- **Lien waiver traps** that make you sign away rights before receiving payment
- **Retainage abuse** where 10% of your money is held for years
- **Indemnification landmines** that make you liable for the GC's mistakes
- **Change order restrictions** that mean extra work you can't bill for

**The result?** 56 days average to get paid. 49% of subcontractors wait 30+ days. Many never get paid at all.
