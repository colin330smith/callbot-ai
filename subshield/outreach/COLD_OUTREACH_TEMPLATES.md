## COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES

### IMPORTANT: Cold Email Best Practices
1. **Keep it short** - Under 100 words
2. **One CTA** - Don't ask for multiple things
3. **Personalize** - Reference something specific
4. **No attachments** - Hurts deliverability
5. **Mobile-friendly** - Most read on phone
6. **Follow up** - 3-5 touches minimum

### EMAIL TEMPLATE 1: Free Value Offer

**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- "Quick question about [Company] contracts"
- "Free contract review for [Company]"
- "[First Name], found something that might help"
- "Saw [Company] on [Job Board] - quick idea"

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Saw [Company] does [type of work] in [City]. Quick question:

How do you currently review contracts before signing them?

I ask because I'm doing free contract reviews for subcontractors this month. AI-powered analysis that flags payment risks, lien waiver issues, and indemnification traps.

Takes 5 minutes. No sales pitch.

If you have a contract you're about to sign (or one you already signed that you're curious about), just reply with the PDF and I'll send back a full risk analysis.

Either way - would love to hear how you handle contract review now.

[Your name]

P.S. - Not trying to replace your lawyer. Just trying to help you know when to call one.
```

### EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: Problem-Focused

**Subject Lines:**
- "pay-if-paid clauses"
- "Quick warning about GC contracts"
- "[First Name], this cost a sub $47K"

**Body:**
```
[First Name],

Quick story: A concrete contractor in Texas signed what he thought was a standard contract. Buried in paragraph 14 was a pay-if-paid clause.

Owner got into a dispute with the GC. Stopped paying.

$47,000 in completed work. Zero payment. Completely legal.

Do you know if any of your current contracts have pay-if-paid language?

I built a tool that catches this stuff. Happy to run one of your contracts through it for free - just to show you how it works.

No pitch. No obligation. Just want to help subs stop getting burned.

Interested?

[Your name]
```

### EMAIL TEMPLATE 3: Social Proof

**Subject Lines:**
- "How [Similar Company] avoided a $30K mistake"
- "Subcontractors are using this..."
- "3 issues in a contract I almost missed"

**Body:**
```
[First Name],

Just helped an [electrical/plumbing/HVAC] contractor in [State] review a contract he was about to sign.

Found 3 issues:
- Pay-if-paid clause (could've meant never getting paid)
- Unconditional lien waivers (signing away rights before payment)
- 10% retainage with no release date (cash flow hostage)

He negotiated 2 of the 3 before signing.

Do you have a contract sitting on your desk right now? I'll run the same analysis for free.

Just reply with the PDF.

[Your name]
```

### EMAIL TEMPLATE 4: Follow-Up #1 (3 days later)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

**Body:**
```
[First Name],

Bumping this up. Did you have a chance to read my note?

Happy to do a free contract review whenever works for you.

Just reply with a PDF and I'll have your analysis back in 24 hours.

[Your name]
```

---

### EMAIL TEMPLATE 5: Follow-Up #2 (7 days later)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

**Body:**
```
[First Name],

Last follow-up, I promise.

Still happy to do a free contract review if you're interested.

If not, no worries - just let me know and I'll stop bugging you.

[Your name]
```

---

### EMAIL TEMPLATE 6: Break-Up Email (14 days later)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

**Body:**
```
[First Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing contract review isn't a priority right now.

Totally get it - you're busy.

I'll close out your file, but if you ever need a quick contract review, just reply to this email. The offer stands.

Good luck with [upcoming project if known].

[Your name]
```

## LINKEDIN DM TEMPLATES

### DM TEMPLATE 1: Connection Request Message

```
Hey [First Name] - saw you run [Company]. I work with subcontractors on contract risk. Would love to connect.
```

---

### DM TEMPLATE 2: After They Accept

```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name].

Quick question - do you review contracts before you sign them, or mostly just skim for the big stuff?

I ask because I'm doing free contract reviews for subs this month. AI-powered analysis that catches payment risks, lien issues, indemnification traps.

Not trying to sell anything - just building relationships in the industry.

If you ever have a contract you want a second set of eyes on, let me know.
```

---

### DM TEMPLATE 3: Direct Approach

```
[First Name] - saw [Company] does [type of work] in [City].

I'm offering free contract reviews this month for subcontractors. Send me any contract PDF and I'll send back a full risk analysis.

Interested?
```

---

### DM TEMPLATE 4: After They Engage With Your Content

```
Hey [First Name] - saw you liked/commented on my post about [topic].

Curious - has that issue come up in your contracts before?

I'm doing free reviews for subs who want a second look at their agreements. Happy to check one for you if you're interested.
```

## COLD CALL SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: Gatekeeper Bypass

**You:** "Hi, is [First Name] available?"

**Gatekeeper:** "Who's calling?"

**You:** "This is [Your name]. I'm doing free contract reviews for subcontractors this month - wanted to see if [Company] might be interested. Is [First Name] the right person to talk to?"

*If they ask more:* "I help subs catch bad contract terms before they sign. Just wanted to offer a free review, no strings attached."

---

### SCRIPT 2: Decision Maker - Cold Open

**You:** "Hey [First Name], this is [Your name]. Got a quick second?"

*Wait for response*

**You:** "I know you're busy so I'll keep this short. I'm reaching out to subcontractors in [City/Industry] offering free contract reviews.

I built an AI tool that reads through contracts and flags payment risks, lien waiver issues, that kind of thing.

Wanted to see if you'd be interested in having one of your contracts analyzed for free. No sales pitch, just want to show you how it works.

Does that sound useful?"

---

### SCRIPT 3: If They Say "What's the Catch?"

**You:** "Fair question. No catch, honestly. I'm trying to build relationships in the industry. If you like what I do, maybe you tell other subs about it. If not, no hard feelings.

But the review is completely free and there's no obligation to buy anything."

---

### SCRIPT 4: If They Say "We Have a Lawyer"

**You:** "Totally makes sense - you should have a lawyer for the big stuff.

This is more like a first line of defense. Instead of paying $400 for a lawyer to review every contract, this catches the obvious stuff so you know when it's worth calling the lawyer.

Most subs I work with use it to screen contracts before deciding which ones need legal review.

Would you be open to trying it on one contract, just to see?"

---

### SCRIPT 5: If They Say "I'm Too Busy"

**You:** "I totally get it. You don't have to do anything - just send me a contract PDF via email and I'll do all the work. Send your analysis back in 24 hours.

Would that work?"

---

### SCRIPT 6: If They Say "Not Interested"

**You:** "No problem at all. Mind if I ask - is it because you already have a good system for reviewing contracts, or just not a priority right now?"

*Listen to their answer - might reveal an opportunity*

**You:** "Got it. Well, if anything changes, feel free to reach out. I'll shoot you an email with my info in case it's useful down the road. Thanks for your time."

---

### SCRIPT 7: Voicemail

**You:** "Hey [First Name], this is [Your name]. I'm doing free contract reviews for subcontractors in [City] this month.

If you have a contract you're about to sign - or one you already signed that you're curious about - I'd love to run it through our analysis for you.

No sales pitch. Just want to show you what we find.

Give me a call back at [number] or shoot me an email at [email].

Thanks."

## PARTNERSHIP OUTREACH

### EMAIL TO TRADE ASSOCIATIONS

**Subject:** Free member benefit: AI contract review for your subs

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to [Association Name] with an offer for your members.

I built SubShield - an AI tool that analyzes subcontractor contracts and flags payment risks, lien waiver issues, and indemnification traps.

Here's what members would get:
- Upload any contract PDF
- Receive full risk analysis within 24 hours
- Plain-English explanations (not lawyer speak)
- Negotiation scripts for any issues found

This could be a great member benefit - and it costs you nothing to offer.

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss?

### EMAIL TO CONSTRUCTION LAWYERS

**Subject:** Referral opportunity - subcontractor contract tool

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I built a tool that helps subcontractors understand their contracts before signing.

It's NOT legal advice - I'm very clear about that. It's more like a first-line screening tool that helps subs know when they NEED a lawyer.

I'm reaching out because I think we could help each other:

1. I refer complex issues to lawyers in my network
2. You potentially refer clients who need ongoing contract screening

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

[Your name]
```

### EMAIL TO CONSTRUCTION SOFTWARE COMPANIES

**Subject:** Partnership idea - contract analysis integration

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] helps subcontractors with [what they do].

I built SubShield - AI-powered contract analysis for subs. We flag payment risks, lien issues, and bad indemnification terms.

I'm wondering if there's a partnership opportunity:

- Integration: Add contract analysis to your existing workflow
- Co-marketing: Joint content, webinars, referrals
- White-label: Offer our analysis under your brand

Our tool is API-ready and we're looking for the right partners to scale.

Worth a conversation?

[Your name]
