## Connection Request Templates

### Template 1: Direct Value
```
Hi [First Name],

I help subcontractors catch payment traps in GC contracts before signing. Things like pay-if-paid clauses that can hold your money hostage.

Would you be open to a quick chat about what you're seeing in contracts lately?
```

### Template 2: Curiosity Hook
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question - do your GCs ever slip pay-if-paid language into contracts?

I'm building something specifically for subs to catch this stuff before signing. Would love your input.
```

### Template 3: Problem Aware
```
Hi [First Name],

Noticed you run [Company]. Curious - how do you currently review GC contracts before signing?

Working on a tool for subs that flags risky clauses. Happy to share what we're finding.
```

## Follow-Up Messages (After Connection)

### Message 1: Immediate (Same Day)
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name].

Quick context - I'm Colin, building SubShield. We use AI to analyze subcontractor contracts and flag risky clauses (pay-if-paid, lien waivers, indemnification traps).

I'm offering free contract reviews to get feedback from real subs. If you have a contract you're about to sign, I'll personally review it and tell you what to watch out for.

Interested?
```

### Message 2: If No Response (3 Days Later)
```
Hey [First Name],

Wanted to follow up - the free contract review offer stands.

Just had a concrete sub in Texas send me one. Found a pay-if-paid clause that would've put $47K at risk. He didn't even know it was in there.

If you've got a contract sitting on your desk, happy to take a look. No strings.
```

### Message 3: Value-First (7 Days Later)
```
[First Name],

Put together a quick checklist for subs to Ctrl+F before signing any contract:

1. "contingent upon" or "when paid" → Pay-if-paid
2. "unconditional" + "waiver" → Signing away lien rights
3. "indemnify" + "any and all" → Covering GC's mistakes
4. "notice" + "24 hours" → Impossible change order deadlines
5. "retainage" (no release date) → Money held indefinitely

Figured you might find it useful. Let me know if you ever want a deeper review on anything.

## DM Script (For Warm Leads)

```
Hey [First Name],

Saw you connected - appreciate it.

I'll cut to it: I'm building SubShield because I saw too many subs get screwed by contracts they didn't fully understand. Pay-if-paid clauses, lien waiver traps, that kind of thing.

Right now I'm doing free contract reviews to:
1. Help subs protect themselves
2. Learn what's actually showing up in contracts

If you have anything you're about to sign - or even one you've already signed that felt sketchy - send it over. I'll analyze it and tell you exactly what's in there.

Takes me about 30 min to review, you get a full breakdown with negotiation scripts.

Worth it?

## LinkedIn Post Templates (For Your Profile)

### Post 1: Story Hook
```
A concrete contractor in Texas signed what looked like a standard subcontract.

Buried in paragraph 14: pay-if-paid language.

Six months later, the owner got into a dispute with the GC. Payments stopped.

The GC pointed to paragraph 14.

"We only pay when we get paid. Take it up with the owner."

$47,000 in completed work. Zero payment. Completely legal.

His lawyer told him he should've caught it.

Easy to say at $400/hour.

---

I'm building SubShield - AI that catches these clauses before you sign.

Currently doing free contract reviews. DM me if you want one.
```

### Post 2: Stat Hook
```
The average subcontractor waits 56 days to get paid.

49% wait 30+ days.

Some never get paid at all.

Why?

Because GC contracts are designed to protect the GC - not you.

Pay-if-paid clauses. Lien waiver traps. Retainage abuse.

They're all legal. They're all common. And most subs don't know they're in there until it's too late.

I'm on a mission to change that.

DM me "CONTRACT" and I'll review yours for free.
```

### Post 3: Question Hook
```
Subcontractors - quick question:

How do you currently review contracts before signing?

A) Lawyer reviews everything ($$$)
B) Read it myself (time-consuming)
C) Skim and sign (risky)
D) Don't review at all (scary)

Comment below - genuinely curious what the reality is.

Feel free to reach out anytime.
```

### If They Ask About Price:
```
Right now I'm doing free reviews to gather feedback and build case studies.
