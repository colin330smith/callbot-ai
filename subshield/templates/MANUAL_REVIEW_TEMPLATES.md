### Follow-Up #2: Did They Take Action? (Day 7)

**Subject:** How did the negotiation go?

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Circling back - did you end up discussing those contract terms
with [GC Name]?

Curious how it went. Always helps me understand what subs are

[Your name]
```

### Follow-Up #3: Convert to Paid (Day 10)

**Subject:** Another contract coming up?

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Hope the [GC Name] situation worked out.

Quick question: Do you have other contracts in your pipeline
that could use the same analysis?

SubShield does this automatically for $49/month. You can upload
contracts anytime and get instant analysis.

Since you did the free review, I can lock you in at **$24.50/month
